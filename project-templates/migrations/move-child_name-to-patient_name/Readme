  ddoc/{index.js, map.js}

    Design doc source files, these are compiled to ddoc.json.  The query here
    is dependent on a custom design doc.  This allows us to identify and
    process the bad data until the database returns no results.
    
  query

    Query database and stream ndjson to stdout. 
    
    Example:

      curl http://localhost:5984/medic/_all_docs?include_docs=true
      
  filter

    Filters ndjson on stdin and writes ndjson to stdout.  Does not modify
    lines, only decides which lines are included in output.

    Example:

      jsonfilter 'rows.*.doc'

  transform, transform.js

    Modifies ndjson and writes ndjson to stdout.

    Example:

      jsonmap --file=transform.js

  update

    Consume ndjson input and bulk save changes to the database, default to
    batches of 100 records.  Write results as ndjson to stdout.

  run 

    Chain ndjson formatted data together on stdin and stdout to run a data
    migration.
